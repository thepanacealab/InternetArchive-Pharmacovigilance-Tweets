# Classical Models
All the classical models use the scikit learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning) for supervised classification. The following 5 classical models are used.
1) Logistic Regression (LR)
2) Support Vector Mechanism (SVM)
3) Random Forest (RF)
4) Decision Tree (DT)
5) Naive Bayes (MNB)

This is compatible with Python 3.7. Please install the following packages before running the code.
1) Scikit- learn - pip install -U scikit-learn
2) Pandas - pip install pandas

You can obtain the Trainind dataset by downloading it from the papers listed under Classification Section in the paper - https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/12/03/859611.full.pdf

Usage - python classify_validate_svm.py
