# Classical Models
All the classical models use the scikit learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning) for supervised classification. The following 5 classical models are used.
1) Logistic Regression (LR)
2) Support Vector Mechanism (SVM)
3) Random Forest (RF)
4) Decision Tree (DT)
5) Naive Bayes (MNB)

Please use the train.csv and test.csv from the paper.
