# Deep Learning Models
In order to run the following models, the following packages must be installed first
1) TensorFlow - pip install Tensorflo or https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
2) Keras - pip install Keras or https://github.com/keras-team/keras
3) Matchzoo - pip install Matchzoo or https://github.com/NTMC-Community/MatchZoo - We recommend to use the github version for matchzoo instead of the pip version

You can obtain the dataset for training it by downloading it from the papers listed under Classification Section in the paper - https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/12/03/859611.full.pdf


Usage of the deep learning models - python ConvKNRM.py
